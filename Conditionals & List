1. Complete the given method solve that accepts as parameter 2 integers a and b.

You have to print True if the numbers are equal and False if they are not equal.

For example: solve(5,5) prints True but solve(1,0) prints False.

Example Input: 5 5
Output: True
Example Input: 1 0
Output: False

PROGRAM:
----------------------
def solve(num1,num2):
    # write your code from here
    if(num1==num2):
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

2. Complete the given method solve that accepts as parameter 2 integers num1 and num2. You have to print that number which has a greater value.

For example: solve(2,3) prints 3 but solve(7,-9) prints 7.

Example Input: 2 3
Output: 2
Example Input: 7 -9
Output: 7

PROGRAM:
----------------------
def solve(num1,num2):
    # write your code from here
    if(num1>num2):
        print(num1)
    else:
        print(num2)

3. You are in-charge of the odd-even machine. Complete the given method solve that takes as parameter an integer. You have to print Odd if the number is odd or Even if the number is even.

Hint: Even numbers, on division by 2, don’t give a remainder. Can you use that to find if a number is even? Try using the % operator.

Example Input: 23
Output: Odd

Example Input: 58
Output: Even

PROGRAM:
-----------------
def solve(num):
    # write your code from here
    if(num%2==0):
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")

4. Complete the given method solve to check if a given number lies in a certain range or not. Accept 3 parameters:

the number to be checked
the start of the range
the end of the range
Print In range if the number is in the range and Not in range if the number is not in the range.

For example: solve(1,5,10) prints Not in range because 1 is not in between 5 and 10.

Example Input: 1 5 10
Output: Not in range

Example Input: 12 12 16
Output: In range

PROGRAM:
------------------------
def solve(num,start,end):
    # write your code from here
    if(num>=start and num<=end):
        print("In range")
    else:
        print("Not in range")

5. Complete the method solve to check if a given number is divisible by either 9 or 20.

Print True if it is and False otherwise.

For example: solve(81) prints True because it is divisible by 9. However, solve(30) prints False because it is neither divisible by 9 nor 20.

Example Input: 81
Output: True

Example Input: 30
Output: False

PROGRAM:
-----------------------
def solve(num):
    # write your code from here
    if(num%9==0 or num%20==0):
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

6. When celebrities get together for a party, they like to have chocolates.

A celebrity party is successful when the number of chocolates is between 20 and 40, inclusive.

Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of chocolates.

You have to complete the method solve that prints true if the party is successful and false if the party fails.

solve takes 2 parameters: an integer and a boolean value.

The integer has the number of chocolates
the boolean is True if it’s the weekend and False if it’s not the weekend.
solve has to print true or false to tell us if the party is successful or not with the given values.

Example Input: 30 false
Output: true

Example Input: 50 false
Output: false

Example Input: 70 true
Output: true

PROGRAM:
-------------------------

        print("true")
    else:
        print("false")

7. You and your friend are movie fans and want to predict if the movie is going to be a hit!

The movie's success formula depends on 2 parameters:

the acting power of the actor (range 0 to 10)
the critic's rating of the movie (range 0 to 10)
The movie is a hit if the acting power is excellent (more than 8) or the rating is excellent (more than 8). This holds true except if either the acting power is poor (less than 2) or rating is poor (less than 2), then the movie is a flop. Otherwise the movie is average.

Complete the given method solve that takes as parameters 2 integers:

the first integer is the acting power
second integer is the critic's rating.
You have to print Yes if the movie is a hit, Maybe if the movie is average and No if the movie is flop.

Example input: 9 5
Output: Yes
Example input: 1 9
Output: No
Example input: 6 4
Output: Maybe

PROGRAM:
----------------------
def solve(acting_power,rating):
    # write your code from here
    if((acting_power>=8 or rating>=8) and (acting_power>2 and rating>2)):
        print("Yes")
    elif(acting_power<=2 or rating<=2):

8. Today, your mother wants to make sweets for you because of your exam results.

She will make 0 Sweets if you scored 60 or less.
She will make 1 Sweet if you scored between 61 and 80 inclusive.
If you scored 81 or higher, she will make 2 Sweets.
However, if it is your birthday, then your mother will consider your score to be 5 higher than it currently is. (Eg, 57 become 62, if it's your birthday)

first an integer that has your score
the second is a boolean value that is true if it is your birthday and false if it is not your birthday
You have to print the number of sweets you will receive (0, 1 or 2) based on the given parameters.

Example: solve(65,false) prints 1 because you scored between 61 and 80, and it is not your birthday.

Example Input: 65 false
Output: 1
Example Input: 57 true
Output: 1
Example Input: 90 false
Output: 2

PROGRAM:
----------------------
def solve(score,is_birthday):
    # write your code from here
    #sweets=0
    if(is_birthday):
        score=score+5
    if(score<=60):
        sweets=0
    elif(score>=61 and score<=80):
        sweets=1
    else:
        sweets=2

20. You have recently seen a motivational sports movie and want to start exercising regularly. Your coach tells you that it is important to get up early in the morning to exercise. She sets up a schedule for you:

On weekdays (Monday - Friday), you have to get up at 5:00. On weekends (Saturday & Sunday), you can wake up at 6:00. However, if you are on vacation, then you can get up at 7:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on weekends.

Write a program to print the time you should get up.

Input Format:

The first line contains n - the number of inputs.
Following that are n lines, each containing an integer and a boolean value.

The integer tells you the day it is (1-Sunday, 2-Monday, 3-Tuesday, 4-Wednesday, 5-Thursday, 6-Friday, 7-Saturday). The boolean is true if you are on vacation and false if you’re not on vacation.

You have to print the time you should get up.

Example Input:
1 false
5 false
1 true

6:00
5:00
9:00
