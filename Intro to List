12. For a number n, we shall define it's k counterpart as the amount needed to be added to n to make it equal to k.

For example,
For 2, the 5 counterpart is 3
For 2, the 10 counterpart is 8
For 27, the 12 counterpart is -15

Complete the given method solve which takes as parameter a list A and a number k.

You have to find out whether the the first element's k counterpart exists in the rest of the list. If yes, print Exists. Otherwise, print Doesn't Exist

Example Input:
10 24 91 8 7 3
20

Output:
Doesn't Exist

Explanation: 10's 20 counterpart is 10, which doesn't exist in rest of the list

        print("Doesn't Exist")

13. We will define a list of integers to be inclusive if it meets the following conditions:

It should have at least 6 elements
The list should contain the mid-point of the first and the last elements of the list
Complete the given method solve which takes as parameter a list A. Return True if the list is inclusive and False if it is not inclusive.

TEST CASES:
-----------------------
Example Input:
10 3 4 5

Output:
False

Explanation: List is less than 6 elements

Example Input:
3 9 8 4 5 7

Output:
True

Explanation: mid-point of 3 and 7 is 5, which exists in the list

PROGRAM:
----------------------
def solve(A):
    # write your code here
    if(len(A)>=6):
        mid=(A[0]+A[-1])//2
        #print (mid)
        if mid in A[1:-1]:
